% Test dataset for unit testing WekaDatasetsMerge
%
% Has the following properties (in conjunction with test-input-2.arff):
% - Has the same number of rows (to test Simple merge)
% - Contains rows where the IDs match, rows where they do not (to test JoinByID merge)
% - Contains multiple class attributes
% - Contains missing values
% - Contains rows where the class values differ between datasets (to test ensureEqualValues)
%
% Should be used in conjunction with test-input-2.arff to create a merged dataset.
